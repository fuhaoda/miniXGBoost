# HaodaVersion Branch

This branch is a  minimalist of XBGoost. 
For a given parameter, it generates one model which can evaluate its performance on 
training data, and can apply the model for prediction.

It does not implement cross validation, bootstrap confidence interval ect. within this version. 
User can manually implement it by themselves.

It is designed for easy to understand, and for research and 
method 
development using 
XGBoost idea.
